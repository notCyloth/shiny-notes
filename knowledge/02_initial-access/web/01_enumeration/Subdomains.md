## ffuf
```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u https://FUZZ.website.com/
```
### vhosts
```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u http://website.com:PORT/ -H 'Host: FUZZ.website.com'
```
This will ALL return 200's but the request size will be different for a successful hit. Thus we take the size of any one of the failed hits and filter it out in the next command:
```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u http://website.com:PORT/ -H 'Host: FUZZ.website.com' -fs [RESPONSE SIZE TO FILTER OUT]
```
## gobuster
```bash
gobuster dns -d 192.168.154.199 -w /usr/share/wordlists/amass/all.txt -t 5
```
```bash
gobuster vhost -u [URL] -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt --append-domain
```
## AssetFinder
Requires go to be installed.
```bash
go get -u github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder
```
```bash
assetfinder [WEBSITE]
```
e.g. assetfinder tesla.com > results.txt

--subs-only flag only searches for directly related subdomains...
## Amass
Requires go to be installed.
```bash
export GO111MODULE=on
```
```bash
go get -v -u github.com/OWASP/Amass/v3/...
```
```bash
amass enum -d [WEBSITE]
```
i.e.
```bash
amass enum -d tesla.com
```
## httprobe (this checks if domains are alive)
Requires go to be installed.
```
go install github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe@latest
```
```bash
cat [LIST OF SUBDOMAINS FILE] | httprobe | sed 's/https\?:\/\///' | sed 's/http\?:\/\///'  | tr -d ':443' | tr -d ':80'
```
## GoWitness (screenshots domains using headless chrome)
```bash
go get -u gorm.io/gorm # Requires Go (duh!)
```
```bash
go get -u github.com/sensepost/gowitness
```
```bash
gowitness single [WEBSITE]
```
e.g. 
```bash
gowtiness single https://tesla.com
```
